Neuroimaging studies have shown that the neural mechanisms of motor imagery (MI) overlap substantially with
the mechanisms of motor execution (ME). Surprisingly, however, the role of several regions of the motor circuit-
ry in MI remains controversial, a variability that may be due to differences in neuroimaging techniques, MI train-
ing, instruction types, or tasks used to evoke MI. The objectives of this study were twofold: (i) to design a novel
task that reliably invokes MI, provides a reliable behavioral measure of MI performance, and is transferable across
imaging modalities; and (ii) to measure the common and differential activations for MI and ME with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We present a task in which it is dif-
ﬁcult to give accurate responses without the use of either motor execution or motor imagery. The behavioral
results demonstrate that participants performed similarly on the task when they imagined vs. executed move-
ments and this performance did not change over time. The fMRI results show a spatial overlap of MI and ME
in a number of motor and premotor areas, sensory cortices, cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus, and ventrolateral
thalamus. MI uniquely engaged bilateral occipital areas, left parahippocampus, and other temporal and frontal
areas, whereas ME yielded unique activity in motor and sensory areas, cerebellum, precuneus, and putamen.
The MEG results show a robust event-related beta band desynchronization in the proximity of primary motor
and premotor cortices during both ME and MI. Together, these results further elucidate the neural circuitry of
MI and show that our task robustly and reliably invokes motor imagery, and thus may prove useful for interro-
gating the functional status of the motor circuitry in patients with motor disorders.

Introduction

Motor imagery (MI) is an internal rehearsal of simple or complex
motor movements without overt physical action (Annett, 1995;
Jeannerod, 1995; Porro et al., 1996). Although difﬁcult to describe
verbally, MI involves kinesthetic and visual imagery and is character-
ized by vivid mental representations of movement execution from a
ﬁrst-person perspective (Munzert et al., 2009; Porro et al., 1996).
Motor imagery plays a critical role in motor skill learning and sports
training (Brouziyne and Molinaro, 2005; Murphy, 1994), as well as
in prosthesis control (Hochberg et al., 2006) and motor rehabilitation
in patients with motor disorders (Dijkerman et al., 2004; Kimberley
et al., 2006; Sharma et al., 2006). Such ample clinical and neurophys-
iological applications of MI emphasize the necessity for deeper under-
standing of the neural mechanisms engaged in motor imagery.
The last two decades have yielded a number of imaging studies in-
vestigating the neural correlates of motor execution (ME) and MI, as
well as their functional overlap, using various techniques, such as

positron emission tomography (PET; e.g., Decety et al., 1994; Naito et
al., 2002; Roland et al., 1980; Stephan et al., 1995), electroencephalogra-
phy (EEG; e.g., Beisteiner et al., 1995; Rodriguez et al., 2004; Thayer and
Johnson, 2006), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; e.g.,
2Lotze et al., 1999; Porro et al., 1996; Roth et al., 1996), and magnetoen-
cephalography (MEG; e.g., Lang et al., 1996; Nagakawa et al., 2011;
Schnitzler et al., 1997). Convergent evidence shows that during ME
the motor and premotor cortices, i.e., the primary motor cortex (M1),
supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-supplementary motor area
(pre-SMA), and ventral and dorsal premotor cortices (vPMC and
dPMC, respectively) are modulated by the cerebello-thalamo-cortical
loop. Other essential ME areas include the basal ganglia, primary so-
matosensory cortex (S1), and posterior parietal cortex—speciﬁcally,
the superior and inferior parietal lobules (SPL and IPL, respectively).
Some studies report that the neural correlates of MI substantially
overlap with those subserving ME (Jeannerod, 2001; Lotze and
Halsband, 2006), especially within the neural circuits involved in the
early stages of motor control (i.e., motor planning). These circuits in-
clude the supplementary motor area, premotor areas, and posterior pa-
rietal cortex. In light of these ﬁndings, Jeannerod (2001) proposed that
ME and MI are functionally equivalent in that the neural processes are
shared but in MI overt production of movement is inhibited. However,
